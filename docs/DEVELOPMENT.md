# Project structure

- Datapull is organized as a monorepo.
- Source code is in `packages/@sbp-datapull` folder
- `packages/datapull` is a symlink to a CLI executable that is used to run exploratory tests

# Get started

1. Install lerna globally:

```
$ npm install -g lerna
```

2. Install dependencies for all modules:

```
$ lerna bootstrap -- --no-shrinkwrap
```

# How to add a dependency to a module

This has to be done by manually navigating to that module's folder. Example:

```
$ cd node_modules/@sbp-datapull/cli
$ npm install commander --save
```

# How to run an exploratory test:

Pick one of the example files and run a preview of that pipeline (preview allows you to fetch data from an origin without pulling it to a destination)

```
$ ./packages/datapull preview examples/http-test.yml
```

# How to publish new version of all updated modules:

```
$ lerna publish
```
